= SEL-751-Arc-Flash-Speed-Up

Tool to speed up settings development for Transpower standard arc-flash protection 

== Installation

This tool:

* uses Python (either 2.7.x or 3.5.x). 
* uses the standard http://www.transpower.co.nz[Transpower] SEL-751 arc-flash protection package.

The purpose of this tool is to:

* allow efficient production of arc-flash protection settings.
* allow efficient production of arc-flash IEC 61850 GOOSE "virtual wiring".
* save people from having to carry out mind-numbingly tedious minor changes.
* save people from making silly mistakes while making minor changes.

== How To Use

. Ensure Python is installed (https://www.python.org/downloads/[how?])
. Ensure Git is installed (https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git[how?])
. Ensure The Transpower standard package is readily accessible.
. Clone this repository (`git clone https://github.com/danyill/SEL-751-Arc-Flash-Speed-Up`)
. Copy the standard package into the root folder of this repository.
. Copy the default configuration file (`default.config`) to something specific to your project.
. Edit the new configuration file. Instructions are included in the file.
. Run the script `automate.py` on the configuration file. Something like `automate.py my_configuration_file.txt`.
. In the `output` folder, you will now find:

.* an `rdb` file
.* an `scd` file
.* a `selaprj` file

. Carry out some checks to see that these look correct.

== TODO

* Import the IEC61850 relay Python script
* Allow for: 

*. dataset changes
*. transmit message name changes
*. MAC address changing and re-numbering

* Investigate default or empty SEL rdb files
* Investigate complexity with opening rdb file
* Copy relays and creating multiple copies.

*. Update the TID. For coupler and riser relays append COUPLER and RISER, e.g. ERE2042 COUPLER.
*. Disable any unused sensors using the AFSENSn setting as detailed in section 4.5.2Error: Reference source not found.
*. Set LT01, LT02 and LT03 according to Table  3 .4 andError: Reference source not found Table  3 .5 and the logic diagram.
*. If the Prot1 relay watchdog  is not wired into this relay, set  SV10 to NA #NOT IN302 #PROT 1 WATCHDOG to disable the front panel alarm.
*. Update settings:

*.. IPADDR
*.. SUBNETM
*.. DEFRTR
*.. TCBAN
*.. FTPCBAN
*.. DNPADR
*.. DNPIP1
